DeveelDB is an Open Source SQL database system for .NET and Mono platforms: its first aim is the portability and the possibility to use it in limited contexts (IoT, mobiles, etc.).

The project has very little resources and no plan for monetization: it also has no website, only the space dedicated in GitHub (https://github.com/deveel/deveeldb), that is difficult to be found and not an easy place to address anyone looking for more information, or willing to collaborate.

Apart from a landing page, it would be nice to have some pages dedicated to the documentation (eg. API, code examples, articles, etc.)
